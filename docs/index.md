# Overview

The most awesome validation engine ever created for PHP.

- Complex rules made simple: `v::numericVal()->positive()->between(1, 255)->validate($input)`.
- [Granularity control](02-feature-guide.md#validation-methods) for advanced reporting.
- [More than 150](08-list-of-rules-by-category.md) (fully tested) validation rules.
- [A concrete API](05-concrete-api.md) for non fluent usage.

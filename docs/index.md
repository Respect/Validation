# Overview

The most awesome validation engine ever created for PHP.

- Complex validation made simple: `v::numericVal()->positive()->between(1, 255)->isValid($input)`.
- [Granularity control](handling-exceptions.md) for advanced reporting.
- [More than 150](list-of-validators-by-category.md) (fully tested) validators.
- [A concrete API](concrete-api.md) for non fluent usage.
